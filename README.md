# odin-recipes
Project being carried out as part of the Odin Project Foundation Course - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

During this project I utilised the following:
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Interal linking to images and elsewhere within the website.
- Use of clean folder structure to allow for ease of expansion.
- Embedding of images.
- Use of 'git clone', 'git add', 'git status', 'git log' and 'git push origin main'.

Overall page is still overall very basic in nature and limited by my lack of CSS / Javascript training at this point. Hopefully will revisit in future.
